**Minesweeper in Java Swing**
A simple desktop implementation of the classic Minesweeper game built with Java Swing.
This project demonstrates event-driven programming, GUI design, and basic game logic such as mine generation, adjacency detection, and win/lose conditions.

**Features**
- Interactive grid of tiles with left- and right-click actions
- Random mine placement each game
- Automatic reveal of surrounding empty tiles (recursive flood-fill)
- Flagging system for suspected mines
- Basic win and loss detection
- Restart option

**What I Learned**
- How to build and manage a GUI using Java Swing components
- Handling mouse events and action listeners
- Implementing 2D array-based logic to track mines and revealed cells
- Separating code into logical classes for cleaner structure (Tile, MinesweeperGame, etc.)
- Debugging and organizing game assets in a Java project

**How to Run**
1. Clone this repository
  _git clone https://github.com/HudsonCox06/Minesweeper.git_
2. Compile the project
   _javac *.java_
3. Run the Game
   _java Minesweeper_
